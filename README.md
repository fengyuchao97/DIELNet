# Rethinking Semantic-level Building Change Detection: Ensemble Learning and Dynamic Interaction

Here, we provide the pytorch implementation of the paper: Rethinking Semantic-level Building Change Detection: Ensemble Learning and Dynamic Interaction.

* For binary-level BCD: 
[binary-level](https://github.com/fengyuchao97/DIELNet/tree/main/CD_for_binary)
* For semantic-level BCD:
[semantic-level](https://github.com/fengyuchao97/DIELNet/tree/main/CD_for_semantic)

Details can be seen in each branch.
